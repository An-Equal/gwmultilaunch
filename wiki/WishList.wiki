= Coming up =

  * Detect the first Guild Wars install at first start
  * Detect whether a copy at a certain location has been launched already, do not attempt to relaunch same copy.
  * Speed up process detection

= Later =
  * Argument creation helper
  * Add button for making an extra copy of Guild Wars
  * Shortcut creation not dependent on windows scripting host dll

= Need help on =
  * Virtualize file access to gw.dat (no need to make multiple copies anymore)
    * Need to add hook into Guild Wars to intercept file opens, file writes, file reads, and file closes. Write operations should be committed to virtual file to prevent exclusive file lock on original gw.dat from occurring.
